In 2025 hubspot is breaking the way we can reference custom objects: https://developers.hubspot.com/changelog/breaking-change-removed-support-for-referencing-custom-object-types-by-base-name

The first attempt to resolve this was to use the fully qualified name, however this is _different_ in sandbox vs prd! The same goes for the objectTypeId.
So if you want to statically reference the same custom object in sandbox and prd, the only way to do that is with the p_ shorthand.
